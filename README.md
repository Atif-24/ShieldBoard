# ShieldBoard

This project stemmed from my curiosity and a desire to refresh my PCB design skills. Upon receiving an email from Altium promoting their new education course on PCB design, I saw an opportunity to enhance my knowledge in this domain. The Altium Education course, open to all, offered a comprehensive understanding of PCB design, and I decided to embark on this learning journey.

For the final project of the course, I conceptualized and developed a Power Regulator and LED Board tailored for Arduino applications. Despite being less complex than a previous 28 PINS PCB project I undertook last year, the significance of this project lied in its educational context. Unlike the previous endeavor which was solely focused on PCB creation, this project not only involved designing the PCB but also deepened my understanding of PCBs and PCB design principles through the structured curriculum provided by Altium Education.
